There are two ways you can build and run the Agape OS - on a Micro System 1
computer (buy one now at [glina.com.au](https://glina.com.au)!) or by building for desktop
and running your own server. The server source code and build instructions
are coming soon - please keep an eye on [our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GlinaCreative)
